In Go programming language, assertion is a mechanism to check the dynamic type of a value during runtime.
It is used to ensure that the value of a variable conforms to a certain type or interface before executing operations on it.
Assertion is particularly useful when dealing with interface types, where the actual type of the underlying value is unknown.
