### Defition #1

Context provides a mechanism to control the lifecycle, cancellation, and propagation of requests across multiple goroutines.
Context is a built-in package in the Go standard library that provides a powerful toolset for managing concurrent operations.
It enables the propagation of cancellation signals, deadlines, and values across goroutines, ensuring that related operations can gracefully terminate when necessary.
With context, you can create a hierarchy of goroutines and pass important information down the chain.

### Defition #2

The Go context package efficiently handles cancellations, timeouts, and passing data between goroutines. The package allows for the functions to have more “context” about the environment they are running in. Passing the context with function calls can propagate contextual information throughout the program’s life cycle. Context is commonly used in environments where concurrent operations’ life cycle management and cancellation are crucial, such as distributed systems.

### Defition #3

It provides a way to carry deadlines, cancellations, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. It is especially useful for managing the execution flow and data sharing in a concurrent or distributed system, where multiple goroutines or services need to coordinate and communicate.

The context package is commonly used to handle situations like:

Cancellation: Propagating a cancellation signal across goroutines and services to terminate work gracefully when it’s no longer needed.
Deadlines: Specifying a time limit for a task to prevent it from running indefinitely.
Request-scoped values: Storing and sharing data (e.g., request ID, user authentication, or tracing information) throughout the execution of a request.
The core concept is the context.Context type, which carries information across API boundaries. You can create a Context using the context.Background() function as a starting point, and then derive new contexts from it as needed.
